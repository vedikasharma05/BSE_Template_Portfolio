# Arduino Air Guitar
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My First milestone was setting up the accelerometer with the arduino. The accelerometer I used had an in-built gyroscope which gave me the position of my hands to imitate a classic guitar. I could not find a documentation for the code library I was working with, so upon doing some research I came across the command sheet of the chips manufacturer. Using that I was able to complete my code. My next step is to finish up the circuit by adding a couple other components and start assembling the device.
