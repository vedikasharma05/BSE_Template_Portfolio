# Arduino Air Guitar
This is an Airduino Air Guitar, consisting of two parts, a glove and a strummer. Using the glove one can choose which note to play and the strummer helps in choosing the pitch and strum the guitar, imitating a normal guitar.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone was the make the glove which would represent the keys of the guitar and put final piece together. Though I did not run into any major problems while doing this but a breakdown was that I accidently broke one of the accelerometer pins which brought a hault to my project for a day. Overall, I am pretty happy with the way this tunred out but in the future I would work on the wiring, improve the code to do multiple tasks at one time and maybe modify this into a Ukulele because there are 4 strings and I have 4 finger controls!

# Second Milestone
My Second Milestone was generating tones with the ultrasonic sensor. I wrote a piece of code that gave me the distance between the UltraSonic sensor's emitter and receiver; the shorter the distance the lower the pitch and the longer the distance the higher the pitch. When I move the breadboard which has the gyroscope in it, a sound is generated indicating a string was plucked. A major issue I had was that I did not know how to generate sounds in the first place. So, I chose a couple of notes, got the frequencies converted it into microseconds and then tested it out. Once I had got that working, I combined it with the distance sensing code. My next goal is to figure out hand controls to indicate what key is being played then assemble the final piece.

# First Milestone
  

My First milestone was setting up the accelerometer with the arduino. The accelerometer I used had an in-built gyroscope which gave me the position of my hands to imitate a classic guitar. I could not find a documentation for the code library I was working with, so upon doing some research I came across the command sheet of the chips manufacturer. Using that I was able to complete my code. My next step is to finish up the circuit by adding a couple other components and start assembling the device.
